MYSQL
-----------------------------
    - MySql is a relational database management system based on the structured query language
    
    - Which is the popular language for accessing and managing the records in the database.

    - MySql is open source

- What is Database??
    - A database is an application that stored the organized collection of records.

    - It can be accessed and manage by the user

    - It allows us to organize data into tables, rows, columns and indexes to find the relevant information very quickly.
    
    - Each database contains distinct API for performing database operations such as creating, managing, accessing and searching the data it stores.

- What is MySql??
    - It allows us to implement database operations on tables, rows, columns and indexes
    
    - It defines the database relationship in the form of tables
    
    - It provides the referential integrity between rows or columns of various tables
    
    - It allows us to updates the table indexes automatically
    
    - It uses many SQL queries and combines useful information for multiple tables for the end-users

- How MySql Works??
    - MySql follows the working of Client - Server architecture.

    - This model is designed for end-users to access the resources from a central computer known as server using network services.

    1. MySql creates a database that allows you to build many tables to store and manipulate data and defining the relationship between each table

    2. Clients make requests through the GUI screen or command prompt by using specific SQL expressions on MySql

    3. Finally, the server application will respond with the requested expressions and produce the desired result on the client side

- Reasons
    - MySql is an open source database

    - MySql is a very powerful program that can handle a large set of functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages

    - MySql is customizable because it is an open source database

    - MySql is quicker than other databases

    - MySql supports many programming languages like JAVA, PHP, PERL, C, C++ etc.,

    - GUI support - MySql Workbench

- Disadvantages
    - MySql version less than 5.0 doesn't support ROLE, COMMIT and stored procedure
    - MySql does not support a ver large database size as efficiently
    - MySql doesn't handle transactions very efficiently and it is prone to data corruption
    - MySql is accused tht it doesn't have a good developing and debugging tool compared to paid databases

    - The sha256_password 
    - The validate_password
    - The ENGINE clause will be deprecated

- Data Types: 
    - A Data Type specifies a particular type of data like integer, floating points, boolean etc., 

    - It also identifies the possible values for that types, the operations that can be performed on that type, and the way of that type are stored.

    - We can determine the data type in MySql with following characteristics:
        1. The type of values (fixed or variable) it represents
        2. The storage space it takes is based on whether the values are fixed or variable
        3. Its values can be indexed or not
        4. How MySql performs a comparison of values of a particular data type


    1. Numeric Data Type: 
        TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT(m, d), DOUBLE(m, d), DECIMAL(m, d), BIT(m), BOOL, BOOLEAN

    2. Data and Time Data Type: 
        YEAR[(2|4)], DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP(m)

    3. String Data Type: 
        CHAR(size), VARCHAR(size), TINYTEXT(size), TEXT(size), MEDIUMTEXT(size), LONGTEXT(size), BINARY(size), VARBINARY(size), ENUM, SET

    4. Binary Large Object Data Type (BLOB):
        TINYBLOB, BLOB(size), MEDIUMBLOB, LONGBLOB

    5. Spatial Data Type: 
        GEOMETRY, POINT, POLYGON, LINESTRING, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION, MULTILINESTRING, MULTIPOINT, MULTIPOLYGON

    6. JSON Data Type:
        - It provides automatic validation of JSON documents. 
        - It provides an optimal storage format

- Variables:
    - MySql have 3 different types of variables
        1. User - Defined
        2. Local 
        3. System

    1. User - Defined Variables:
        1. By using SET statement
            SET @var_name = value;

        2. By using SELECT statement
            SELECT @var_name := value;

        Examples: 
            > SET @name = "peter";
            > SELECT @name;

        Examples:
            > SELECT @maxage := MAX(age) FROM students;

            > SELECT @var1;

    2. Local Variables: 
        syntax:
        > DECLARE var_name datatype(size) [DEFAULT default_value];
        
        example:
        > DECLARE total_price Oct(8, 2) DEFAULT 0.0;

        example: 
        > DECLARE a, b, c INT DEFAULT 0;

    3. System Variables: 
        1. To see the current values used by the running server, execute the following command.
            > SHOW VARIABLES;

            or 

            > SELECT @@var_name

        2. When we want to see the value based on its compiled-in defaults
            > mysqld --verbose --help

    Examples: 
        > SHOW VARIABLES LIKE '%wait_timeout%';
        > SELECT @@key_buffer_size;
        

- MySql Installation

- What is the Primary Key?
    - A Primary Key is a single field or combination of fields that contains a unique record.

    - It must be filled.

    - None of the fields of the primary key can contain a null value.

    - A table can have only one primary key.


- MySql Connection
    - A connection is a computer science facility that allows the user to connect with the database server software.

    - A user can connect with the database server, whether on the same machine or remote locations. 

- MySql Connection Types:
    - Once we are done with installation of MySql, we can connect it using any of the client programs that are listed: 
        1. Command-line client
            > EXIT;

        2. MySql Workbench


- MySql Create User
    > CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] account_name@localhost IDENTIFIED BY password;
    > CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS javabsc@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'jbsc123';

    Selecting all Users in MySql:
    > SELECT USER FROM MYSQL.USER;

- Grant Privileges to the MySql User
    - MySql server provides multiple types of privileges to a new user account.
        1. ALL PRIVILEGES - it permits all previleges to a new user account
        2. CREATE - it enables the user account to create databases and tables
        3. DROP
        4. DELETE
        5. INSERT
        6. SELECT
        7. UPDATE

    > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO javabsc@localhost;
    > GRANT CREATE, SELECT, INSERT ON *.* TO javabsc@localhost;
    > FLUSH PRIVILEGES
    > SHOW GRANTS FOR javabsc@localhost;
