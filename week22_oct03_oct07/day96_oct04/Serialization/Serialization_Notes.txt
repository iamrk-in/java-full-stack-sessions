-> What is Serialization?
    - Serialization is a mechanism to convert an object into stream of bytes so that it can be written into a file, transported through a network or stored into a database. 

    - De-Serialization is just a vice-versa.

    - In other words, the Serialization is converting an object to stream of bytes and de-Serialization is re-building the object.

    Example: SerializationStudent.java (Serialization Concept of Student Example)
    Example: SerializationOfObject.java (converting the Serialization of Object into Stream of Bytes)

    Example: DeSerializationOfObject.java
