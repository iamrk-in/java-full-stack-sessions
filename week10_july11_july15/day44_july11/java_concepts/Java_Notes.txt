-> Introduction to Java Programming
    - Java was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc., in 1991.
    - Later acquired by Oracle Corporation.

    - It was developed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton.
    - It is a simple Programming Language.
    - Writing, Compiling and Debugging a program is easier in Java.
    - It helps to create Modular Programs and reusable code.

-> Java Terminology:
    - Java Virtual Machine (JVM): Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, loads, verifies and executes Java bytecode. It is known as the interpreter or the core of Java programming language because it executes Java programming.
    - The phases of program execution: 
        - we write the program, then we compile the program and at the last we run the program
        1) writing the program
        2) compilation of program done by 'javac' compiler, javac is a primary java compiler included in Java Development Kit (JDK), it takes java program as input and generates the bytecode as output.
        3) jvm executes the bytecode generated by compiler

    - each operating system has different JVM, however the output they produce after execution of bytecode is same across all operating systems

    - bytecode: the javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. the bytecode is saved in a '.class' file by compiler

    - Java Development Kit (JDK): The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment - used for developing 'Java applications' and 'applets'. It includes the: Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

    - what is java applications: A Java application is a program written in Java that is executed stand-alone either in a client or a server. The JVM interprets the instructions and executes the program in the JRE, where the Java programs gain complete access to every computer resource available in the computer system.

    - Java application examples: Netbeans, IntelliJ, and Eclipse are some examples of programs that utilize Java programming. 

    - Types of Java applications: (4)
        1. Standalone
        2. Web 
        3. Enterprise 
        4. Mobile

    - Java Runtime Environment (JRE): JRE is a part of JDK  which means that JDK includes JRE. 

-> Main features of Java: 
    1. Independent Programming Language
    2. Object Oriented Programming Language
        1. Abstraction
        2. Encapsulation
        3. Inheritance
        4. Polymorphism
    3. Simple and Robust Language
    4. Secure
    5. Distributed
    6. Multithreading: In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU. A thread in Java is a lightweight process requiring fewer resources to create and share the process resources.
    7. Portable

-> History of Java: 
    - the versions of JDK - JDK 1.0 to JDK 17
    - stable JDK 8
