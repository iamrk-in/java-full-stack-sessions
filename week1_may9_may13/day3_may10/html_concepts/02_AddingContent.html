        <h1>A Template for Killer Website Content</h1>

        <p>Over the years of <a href="#">developing websites</a>  for clients, I’ve learned that the age-old adage, <strong> “If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself,” </strong> can be a two-way street.</p>
        
        <p>Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy <u> (that we slaved over) </u> into an ineffective <a href="01_CreatingStructureHtml.html">“brochure site”</a> gives me heartburn. But sometimes you have to pick your battles.</p>
        
        <p>In cases where we give in and let the client take the content reins, we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a fighting chance to <i> produce effective website </i> content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use, and an explanation of what’s included.</p>

        <h4>Science and technology</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Florida (United States postal abbreviation)</li>
            <li>Liechtenstein (Fürstentum Liechtenstein)</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Biology and medicine</h4>
    
        <ul>
            <li>FLT3LG (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand), a protein</li>
            <li>
                Fluffy transcription factor, gene of Neurospora crassa
                <ol>
                    <li>Florida (United States postal abbreviation)</li>
                    <li>Liechtenstein (Fürstentum Liechtenstein)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Fluorouracil (5-FU), and leucovorin (folinic acid)</li>
            <li>A chemotherapy regimen for treating colon cancer</li>
        </ul>

            <dt>Headlines</dt>

            <dd>As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a headline and programming the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice Google juice.</dd>

            <dt>Sub-headlines:</dt>

            <dd>Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused sub-headlines can really boost the odds that your page will be read. I like to run a “scan test” on every page  to see if I can get the gist of page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action.</dd>

        <h3>Website content <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">template components</a></h3>

        <p>Pre-writing questions: Before starting any given page, you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and to whom this page is targeted. <br /> What’s their pain? <br /> What’s in it for them? <br /> Where are they in their buying process? <br /> And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your solution? <br /> The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.</p>
