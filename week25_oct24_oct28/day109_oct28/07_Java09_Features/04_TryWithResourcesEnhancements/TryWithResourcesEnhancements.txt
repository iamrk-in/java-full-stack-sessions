Try with Resources Enhancements
-------------------------------------------------
    - This statement was first introduced in Jav 7, to avoid the 'redundant code' that we had to write for 'exception handling'

    The advantages of this:
    1. Try with resources closes all the resources (file, database connection, network connection etc.,) automatically, no need to close them explicitly. This prevents memory leaks

    2. With the help of 'try with resource' we can reduce the unnecessary lines of code and makes the code more readable.

- How we ued to write the code in Java 7 using Try-With-Resource?
    Example: TryWithResourceInJavaSeven.java

- Problem with Try-With-Resources in Java 7
    - There were certain issues with the Try - With - Resource statement in Java 7. 
    - This statement didn't allow the resources to be declared outside of the statement block.

    Example: Resource declared outside the Try-With-Resources block
    ResourceDeclaredOutsideTryWithResourceBlock.java
