Object Oriented Programming part in Java
===========================================
- the OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects' that contains 'data' and 'methods'
- the primary purpose of OOP is used to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs
- the OOP brings together the data and its methods in a single location (object) which makes it easier to understand how a program works

Things what we are covering:
------------------------------------
1. what is an object
2. what is a class
3. constructor in java
4. OOP features:
    1. abstraction
    2. encapsulation
    3. inheritance
    4. polymorphism
5. abstract class and methods
6. interfaces in java
------------------------------------

1. what is an object: object -> is an instance of -> class
    - object is a bundle of data and its behavior
    - objects have 2 characteristics: states and behaviors
    
    examples of states and behaviors:
    example1: 
        object: house
        state: address, color, area
        behavior: open door, close door
    
    Example Code: AnExample1OfObject.java

    example2: 
        object: car
        state: color, brand, weight, model
        behavior: break, accelerate, slow down, gear change

- Characteristics of Objects: 
    1. abstraction: an abstraction is a process where you show only 'relevant' data and 'hide' unecessary details of an object from the user

    2. encapsulation: encapsulation simply means binding the object state(fields) and behavior(methods) together, if you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation

    3. message passing: a single object by itself may not be very useful. an application contains many objects. one object interacts with another object by invoking methods on that object. it is also referred as 'method invocation'

2. what is a class: a class can be considered as a blueprint using which you can create as many objects as you require. 
    
    Example Code: AnExampleOfClass.java

3. what is constructor: the constructor looks like a function (method) but it is infact not a method. it's name is same as class name and does not return any value. 
    example: MyClass obj1 = new MyClass();

4. OOP features: 
    1. abstraction: an abstraction is a process where you show only 'relevant' data and 'hide' unecessary details of an object from the user

    2. encapsulation: the encapsulation simply means binding object state (fields) and behavior (methods) together
    Example: EncapsulationExample.java

    3. inheritance: the process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalists of another class
    Example: MathTeacher.java

    - There are different types of Inheritance:
        1. Single Inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where a class extends the another class. B -> A

        2. Multilevel Inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where a class extends the child class. C -> B -> A

        3. Hierarchial Inheritance: refers to a child and parent class relationship where more than one class extends the same class. B -> A, C -> A

        4. Multiple Inheritance: refers to the concept of one class extending more than one classes, which means a child class has 2 parent classes. (note: Java doesn't support the Multiple inheritance). C -> B, C -> A

    4. polymorphism: the polymorphism allows you to perform a single action in different ways
    Example: UnderstandingPolymorphism.java

    - Types of polymorphism: 
        1. Static polymorphism: the polymorphism that is resolved during compiler time is known as static

        2. Dynamic polymorphism: the polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overidden method is resolved at runtime
    
    - Method Overload:
