            3. class and object

        3. Misc., 
            1. undefined
            2. null

-> Keywords: 
    - Keyword is a Pre - Defined word
    - The concept of keyword is used to do an action which is already defined by javascript developer; where the browser can understand and executed your program accordingly;
    - list of keywords: and, or, if, try, else, switch etc., 

-> Comment: 
    - It's a point of skipping the statement(s) at the time of execution
    - It gives a clear idea to the programmer what that concept is saying
    - We can create in comment in 2 different ways (same like css)
        1. Single Line - // ................
        2. Multi Line - /* ..... */

-> Variables: 
    - a variable is a name - which holds the data; and that can be used where ever or when ever it is required;
    - There are 3 different ways, that we can declared the variables
        1. using the keyword - 'var'
        2. using the keyword - 'let'

    - to access all the items we use indexing

-> Functions: 
    - a function is a reusable set of statements
    - function call and its definition
    - difference between global variables and local variables
    - passing parameters to function
    - return statement
    - anonymous function
    - arrow function
    - callback function

-> Events, Nodes, Selectors:
    - understand the 'document object model' - defines the logical structure of the documents and the way in which they can be accessed and manipulated by the application program
    - selecting the elements

-> Timers: 
    - setInterval()
    - setTimeout()

-> Date and Time
-> Math Operations

-> BOM (browser object model)
    - Window
    - Screen
    - Location
    - History
    - Navigator
    - Dialog Boxes
    - Timers

-> Event Listeners

-> Closures: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

-> JSON: Javascript Object Notation; It is used to parse the data between the Client and Server; Working with RestApi's;
