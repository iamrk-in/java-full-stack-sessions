        <h1>Typical web page structure and formatting guidelines</h1>

        <p>After years of <a href="#">experimenting</a>, most of us web folks have the best practices of website content nailed down, and we feel like this template covers the bases. Here are a few key elements:</p>
        
        <h3>Headlines</h3>

        <p>As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a <a href="#">headline and programming</a> the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice Google juice.</p>
        
        <h4>Businesses and organizations</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>AirTran Airways (IATA airline code), defunct American airline</li>
            <li>FL Group, an <a href="#">Icelandic investment company</a>  with an emphasis on flight and tourism industry</li>
            <li>Foot Locker (ticker symbol), retailer</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Numismatics</h4>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Florin (disambiguation), various coins</li>
            <li>Guilder, various coins also sometimes called "florin"</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Sub-headlines:</h3>
        
        <img src="images/getaways.png" alt="" title="" />
        
        <p>Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused sub-headlines <a href="#">can really boost the odds</a> that your page will be read. I like to run a “scan test” on every page  to see if I can get the gist of page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action. </p>
