-> Arrays Parallel Sort:
    - Java 8 introduced a new method parallelSort() in the Arrays class of java.util package. 

    - This method is introduced to support the parallel sorting of array elements.

    - Alogorithm of parallel sorting: 
        1. The given array is divided into the sub arrays and the sub arrays are further divided into the their sub arrays, this happens untill the sub arrays reaches a minimum graularity.

        2. The sub arrays are sorted individually by multiple threads. The parallel sort uses Fork / Join Framework for sorting sub arrays parallelly.

        3. The sorted sub arrays are merged.

    - Advantages of Parallel Sort over Simple Sort:
        - The parallelSort() method uses the concept of multithreading which makes it much faster compared to the normal sort when there are lot of elements

    - Example: Sorting Primitive Data Types with Parallel Sort
        SortingPrimitiveDataTypesWithParallelSort.java

    - Example: Parallel Sort by Specifying the Start and End Index
        ParallelSortBySpecStartEndIndex.java
