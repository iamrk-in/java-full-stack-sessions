-> Stream Collectors Class
    - Collectors is a 'final class' that extends the object class.

    java.lang.Object
        |
        |-- java.util.stream.Collectors

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Final keyword - Final Variable, Method and Class
    - final keyword can be used along with variables, methods and classes.

        1. final variable
        2. final method
        3. final class

1. final variable: 
    - final variables are nothing but constants.
    - we cannot change the value of a final variable once it is initialized.

    Example: FinalVariableExample.java

- Blank final variable:
    - a final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as 'blank final variable'.

    - we must initialize the blank final variable in constructor of the class, otherwise it will throw a compilation error

    Example: BlankFinalVariableExample.java

- What's the use of blank final variable??
    - let's say, we have a Student class which is having a field called Roll No., Since Roll No., should not be changed once the Student is registered, we can declare it as a final variable in a class but we cannot initialize Roll No., in advance  for all the Students. 
    
    - In such a case we can declare Roll No., variable as blank final and we initialize this value during object creation like this: 

    Example: StudentDataWithBlankFinalVariable.java

- Uninitalized static final variable??
    - a static final variable that is not initialized during declaration can only be initialized in 'static block'.

    Example: UninitalizedStaticBlockVariable.java
    
-> Static Class, Block, Methods and Variables:
    - 'static' keyword can be used with class, variable, method and block.
    - 'static members' belong to the class instead of a specific instance, this means, if you make a member 'static', you can access it without object. 

    - Static:
    Example: SimpleStaticExample.java

    - Static Block:
        - Static Block is used for initializing the static variables. 
        - This block gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory., 
        - A class can have multiple Static blocks, which will execute in the same sequence in which they have been written into the program.

        Example: SingleStaticBlock.java

        Example: MultipleStaticBlocks.java

    - Static Variables:
        - a static variable is common to all the instances of the class because it is a class level variable.

        - only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class.

        - memory allocation for such variables only happens once when the class is loaded in the memory.

            1. static variables are also know as class variables
            2. unlike 'non-static variables', such variables can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods.

        Example: Static Variables can be accessed directly in Static method.
        StaticVariablesAccessedDirectlyStaticMethod.java

        Example: Static Variables are Shared among all the Instances of a Class
        StaticVariablesSharedAmongAllInstancesClass.java

    - Static Methods: 
        - static methods can access class variables (static variables) without using object (instance) of the class, however non-static methods and non-static variables can only be accessed using objects.

        - static methods can be accessed directly in static and non-static methods.

        - syntax: 
        static keyword followed by return type, followed by method name
        static return_type method_name()

        Example: static method main is accessing static variables without object
        StaticMethodMainAccessStaticVariablesWithoutObject.java

        Example: static method accessed directly in static and non-static method
        StaticMethodAccessDirectlyStaticNonStaticMethod.java

    - Static Class: 
        - a class can be made 'static' only if it is a nested class

            1. nested static class doesn't need reference of outer class
            2. a static class cannot access non-static members of the outer class

        - Example: Static Class Example
        StaticClassExample.java
