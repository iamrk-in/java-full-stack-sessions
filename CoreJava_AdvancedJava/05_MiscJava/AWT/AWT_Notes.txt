-> What is AWT?
    - AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit.
    - It is a platform dependent API for creating Graphical User Interface (GUI).

-> Why AWT is a platform dependent? 
    - Java AWT calls native platform (Operating Systems) subrouting for creating components such as textbox, checkbox, button, etc., 

    - For eg., an AWT GUI having a button would have a different look and feel across platform like windows, mac, unix

    - AWT directly calls their native subroutine that creates the button.

    - AWT components are considered heavy weight because they are being generated by underlying operation systems (OS).

    - Swing is a prefrred API for window based applications because of its platform independent and light-weight nature. 

    - Swing is built upon AWT API however it provides a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. 

    - It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT.

    - Components such as buttons, checkbox, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists.

-> Components and Containers: 
    - All the elements like buttons, text fields, scrollbars etc., are known as components. 

    - In AWT we have classes for each component.
    - To have everything placed on a screen to a particular position, we have to add them to a container.

    - A container is like a screen wherein we are placing components like buttons, text fields etc., 
    - A container is itself a component.


-> Types of Containers: 
    - a container is a place wherein we add components like text, field, button, checkbox etc., 

    - There are 4 types of containers: Window, Frame, Dialog and Panel

    - Window: An instance of the Window class has no border and no title
    - Dialog: Dialog class has border and title. An instance of the Dialog class cannot exist without an associated instance of the Frame class
    - Panel: Panel does not contain title bar, menu bar or border. It is a generic container for holding components. An instance of the Panel class provides a container to which to add components.
    - Frame: A frame has title, border, menu bars etc., It can contain several components like buttons, text fields etc., 

-> AWT Example: 
    - Create a GUI using Frame:
        1. By extending Frame Class.
        2. By creating the instance of Frame class 

    - Example1: Creating Frame by Extending Frame Class
    CreatingFrameExtendingFrameClass.java

    - Example2: Creating Frame by Creating Instance of Frame Class
