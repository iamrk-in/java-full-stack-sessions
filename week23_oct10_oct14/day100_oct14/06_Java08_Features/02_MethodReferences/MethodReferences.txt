2. Method References: 
    - Method Reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method. 

    - ex., str -> System.out.println(str)
    - then, we can replace it with a method reference
    - ex., System.out::println

    - the :: operator is used in method to separate the class or object from the method name

    - Four types of method references:
        1. Method reference to an instance method of an object - object::instanceMethod
        2. Method reference to a static method of a class - Class::staticMethod
        3. Method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary method of a particular type - Class::instanceMethod
        4. Method reference to a constructor - Class::new

Example1: Method reference to an instance method of an object - object::instanceMethod
MethodReferenceInstanceMethodObject.java

2. Method reference to a static method of a class - Class::staticMethod
MethodReferenceStaticMethodClass.java

3. Method reference to an instance method of an arbitrary method of a particular type - Class::instanceMethod
MethodReferenceInstanceMethodArbitraryMethodParticularType.java

4. Method reference to a constructor - Class::new
MethodReferenceConstructor.java
